# waterSim
Simulation of particles of water.
This uses python, mainly tkinter and numpy to move water. It is not perfectly accurate with accordance to physics, but it is an attempt.

Run main.py to see functionality. One may need to install numpy, matplotlib, and tkinter for this to work as my dependencies folder was too large for me to upload.
